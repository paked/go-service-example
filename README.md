# pay
easy, quick, small, secure payments: digital cash.

## What is pay?

Pay is a system for making payments. It is designed to be used for small casual transfers.

## How does it work?

When a user clicks on the buy button, a token which is only valid for a short amount of time is sent to store owners API where it is used to request a payment. This way the user never exposes their credit card, making it quick and secure.

## Why not use paypal?

Paypal was not designed to be used like cash.
